	<div class='controlBoxContent'>
	
		<p class='smallText'> SabaiOpen is an open source project created with the goal of being a easy to use but highly powerful interface to OpenWRT. The software is created to run on mips through 64-bit x86 hardware and driven by you, the end user.</p>
		
		<p class='smallText'>SabaiOpen is a great router interface and is special for several reasons:</p>
		
		<ul class='smallText'>			
			<li> First, it is cross-platform, able to work on a wide array of hardware. The software will be released under an open source license and based on OpenWRT, meaning it will work on MIPS, ARM and x86 platforms.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li> Secondly, SabaiOpen is driven by the consumer / enthusiast. The open source community will have the opportunity to develop for this platform and will actually support the functionality they are looking for at the heart of the network. The extensibility opportunity is amazing and until now, the platform just hasn&#39;t existed. 
			</li>
		</ul>
